  // This bothers me. It is clear that the engine must be on the module path at test time, but this test module does not in
  // fact do anything with it. The "requires" syntax suggests incorrectly that it does. A better approach would be to always and everywhere do --add-modules org.junit.jupiter.engine
  // requires org.junit.jupiter.engine;
